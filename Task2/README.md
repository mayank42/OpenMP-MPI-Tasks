## Description
This is part of an experiment with optimizing OpenMP program on solving the N-body problem.

### The workflow

* Step 1: tracking the thread time  

   First I have run a naive implmentation with a different number of threads. The total time taken in each case is depicted in the     chart below:

   Also the per iteration dynamics can be seen in the graph below:

* Step 2: TODO
